# High

* Are log diagrams working correctly and can we build the from all function: `getRatedDiasForElements()` and `processDiagram()`
* Write documentation:
  * <https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#multiple-man>
  * <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44799326/r-documenting-ellipsis-arguments-with-roxygen2-in-s4-generic>
  * @inherit, @inheritParams
    <https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/reuse.html#inheriting-documentation>


# Medium

* Test for generated diagram pairs from `diagramsToGenerate()`:
  E.g. `diagramsToGenerate(c('A', 'B'))` correct what is produced?
* Export wordcounting

# Low

* Test intersection regions and their areas with three circles -- like classic Venn diagrams with three sets
